        everything was an European background, your upbringing your teaching
        school in school My father was a pastor you know missionary a pastor and
        everything had to be English we're not even allowed to speak our
        country's language in schools and they called our own languages
        vernacular so English was the real language you had to speak in school
        so everything was in English with what were taught in schools nobody was
        thinking of whether to be African or not we just accepted that we were
        English and everybody that went to England for studies was a master you
        know everybody Wants to go to England to come back home to be master you
        know so I never thought about it African as such so it didn't mean
        anything to me until much later in my life it was in England I started
        to feel the awareness of How to be an African because for the first time
        I came to England I started to feel oh wow so this white people don't
        like us Too much you know this is my experience from having to rent
        rooms you know I had so much at that time you read the newspapers in
        England house for rent no coloreds no dogs and I'll see that annoyed me
        a lot and then many students So in my student days in England I said to
        be aware of having to be an African but we had nothing to offer as
        Africans because we all just taught English like one of the latest songs
        I'm singing now I said teacher don't teach me nonsense right now I was
        trying to make this my people see because in Africa people respect
        teachers you know teachers because they teach English and they teach
        their pupils you know respect teachers and Revd pastors you know in
        Africa so okay now I saw that I should not use teacher as my focus so I
        said I title the song teacher Dont teach me nonsense now I now move this
        song to let the people see that white men have taught us everything we
        know but I make people see also that one importantly thing they taught
        us was politics because I wove into the song to the elections in Nigeria
        the because it was a farce now I mentioned democracy now in English in
        English man will say Demo democracy but if the Africa man wants to say
        it in broken we will say demo-cera-sy you see now and I'm thought of the
        word I said Demo-cera-zy now I saw craziness I said I could now see my
        people let my people see a democracy really is not that war that is
        really madness you know so I said now now as I Started to sing I said I
        start to think of this word democracy democracy Crazy demo demonstration
        of craze Crazy demonstration then I went a little bit serious because I
        know that people will laugh at that when they hear that now i went a
        little bit serious i said now if it's not crazy why that in Africa as
        time goes forward things getting worse poor man dey cry rich Man dey
        mess democracy crazy demo demonstration of craze then I ended up not to
        fuck the minds of the colonialists up I said if good teacher teach
        something if a good teacher teaches something and student make mistake
        teacher must tell him that he is making mistake
